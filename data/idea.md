NLP AI, like GPT-3, achieved astonishing progress in recent years. There are open source version of GPT (GPT-J w/ 6 billion parameters) available on github, which we can fine tune the pre-trained model to our needs. Imagining that if we use our iag confluence pages or github data to train a model, and create a human-like bot to answer questions, that could be really cool, right?
